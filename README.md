# Project Huff

Engine: Unity

## Description
Project Huff is a 2D platforming game I have been developing independently. It's a passion project I have been creating in my free time since May 2024.
The game centers around a cloud Huff, who, after being convinced by his friends, tries a substance *voltage* which enhances his abilities. Quickly, Huff finds himself dependent on using *voltage*, unable to stop using it throughout the game.
The game will feature 8 levels, each featuring a distinct color scheme, its own music track, a comic strip before the level, a hidden art piece as a collectible, and possibly a boss fight for each level.

## Current Status [08/17]
Much of the game's mechanics are built, and the first 1/2 of the first level is finished. Also, the main menu and the level select screen are mostly complete.
7/8 art pieces are complete, 1 of the comics, and 1 of the music tracks.
